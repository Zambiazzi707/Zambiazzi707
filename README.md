## Hi there 👋

About me :smiley::skull::mage_man:

My name is Henrique dos Santos Zambiazi from Brazil (🇧🇷). I am an IT student and I am looking for a future in this area, mainly in software issues.

In my free time I like to play video games (🎮), play football (⚽), I love listening to music (🎶) and I'm also fascinated by design (🖌️).


Would you like to find me?
